## Dynamical systems on torus
__Definition:__ $n$-dimensional _torus_ is the direct product of $n$ circles $S^1$, i.e. $T^n=S^1\times S^1\times ... S^1$.

So, the 2D torus is $T^2=S^1\times S^1$.  The plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ is local diffeormorphic covering of $T^2$, therefore the map $\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow T^2$ allows us to "translate" picture from torus to plane and vice versa. The smooth functions on torus are $2\pi$-periodic functions on $T^2$. To each closed curve on plane
